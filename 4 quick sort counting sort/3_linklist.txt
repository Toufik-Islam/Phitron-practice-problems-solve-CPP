3. Why do you think linked-list requires more memory than an array when storing the same number of elements?

Ans: In a linked-list, each element (node) contains both a value and a reference to the next element in the list. In contrast, an array stores its elements contiguously in memory, so each element only requires enough memory to store its value.

Additionally, in a linked-list, for each element you need to store the reference to the next element and this reference is stored as a memory address. This memory address takes up extra space in memory.
