Stack, Queue, and Deque are all abstract data types used in computer science and programming. Here are some key differences between them:

    1.Stack:
        A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
        Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack only.
        Common operations include push (adding an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removing the top element from the stack).
        Example: undo/redo operations, function call stack.

    2.Queue:
        A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
        Elements are added at the back (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue) of the queue only.
        Common operations include enqueue (adding an element to the back of the queue) and dequeue (removing the front element from the queue).
        Example: printing jobs, message queue.

    3.Deque:
        A double-ended queue that allows insertion and removal from both ends.
        Can function as both a stack and a queue depending on how elements are added or removed.
        Common operations include push/pop from both ends and enqueue/dequeue from both ends.
        Example: sliding window algorithm, implementing LRU cache.
